# ü§ñ LLM-RL-Assistant

**LLM-RL-Assistant** is an intelligent conversational assistant that uses **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to optimize user prompts in real-time before sending them to **Groq LLM APIs**. The system is designed to run the server-side components on a **Raspberry Pi**, while the user interacts via a **smartphone-based web UI**. The phone communicates with the Pi over a local **Wi-Fi network** using API and WebSocket calls.

## üîÅ Project Flow

1. **User speaks or types a prompt** into the web app (on smartphone)
2. The prompt is sent via **API call to Raspberry Pi**
3. A selected **RL model (PPO, DDPG, A2C, SAC)** rewrites the prompt for clarity
4. The optimized prompt is forwarded to **Groq LLM API**
5. The response is returned to the phone and shown/spoken to the user
6. The user provides **feedback (thumbs up/down or rating)**
7. Additionally, the system collects **AI-based feedback** such as:
   - Groq‚Äôs own self-evaluation of prompt clarity
   - Hallucination checks via fact-verification APIs or cosine similarity
   - Sentiment analysis of the response and user reaction
8. All feedback is converted into a **reward**, helping the RL model learn
9. All interactions and scores are stored and shown in a metrics dashboard

## üì± Deployment Architecture

```plaintext
Smartphone (Browser UI)
     ‚Üì   ‚Üë     [ REST + WebSocket ]
Raspberry Pi (Server: API + RL + Groq)
     ‚Üì   ‚Üë
Groq API (LLM Responses + Self-Evaluation)
```

## üéØ Project Goals
- Run lightweight server with RL models and Groq integration on Raspberry Pi
- Offer mobile-first web UI to users for real-time LLM interaction
- Optimize prompt quality using human and AI-based feedback
- Use RL to learn from both explicit ratings and implicit signals (sentiment, hallucination score, Groq evaluation)
- Visualize performance across multiple RL models over time

### Let‚Äôs build smarter prompts, one reward at a time.
